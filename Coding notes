This is a notebook for different sections to request additional codes/graphics for adjustments. 

1) For graphic, please create a background picture that is slightly larger in poportion than the size of the game.
for example, if the game is 8*8 then the background would be 1600*1600 pixel so on

2) please make the size of the mole/professor similar to the size of the cave and the cave will not fully cover the mole, 
since resizing can be a pain. The cave size preferably will be 1/4th or less of each square just incase the brower formatting issues.

3) for music files, please create a background music in mp3 form. 

4) The game doesn't fit on different screen sizes. For example, it doesn't fit on my screen size of 1920x1080.



additional notes:

I have created a semi-functional mole/pokemon game, in case you need to swap codes or designs or testing graphic size before
finalize our group codes. The source codes can be found here. https://github.com/WillSnakeTaka/knock-offPokeMole

Here is the sample game site: (click music, then click start, 
the game ends when music ends): https://fry.himitsuhimitsun.repl.co
